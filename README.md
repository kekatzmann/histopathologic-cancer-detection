Week 3: CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

This repo contains the code and data for the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) Kaggle competition as part of the DTSA-5511 course at CU Boulder. The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify histopathologic images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.
